PyCon 2013 Scikit-learn Tutorial
================================

*Instructor: Jake VanderPlas*

This repository will contain files and other info associated with my PyCon
2013 scikit-learn tutorial.  I anticipate working on this during the weeks
leading up to PyCon, so check back here often for updates!

Installation Notes
------------------
This tutorial will require recent installations of *numpy*, *scipy*,
*matplotlib*, *scikit-learn*, and *ipython* with ipython notebook.
The last one is important: you should be able to type

    ipython notebook

in your terminal window and see the notebook panel load in your web browser.
Because Python 3 compatibility is still being ironed-out for these packages
(we're getting close, I promise!) participants should plan to use Python 2.6
or 2.7 for this tutorial.

For users who do not yet have these  packages installed, a relatively
painless way to install all the requirements is to use a package such as
[Anaconda CE](http://store.continuum.io/ "Anaconda CE"), which can be
downloaded and installed for free.

Data Downloads
--------------
We will use several data sets for this tutorial. Because the wireless network
at conferences can often be spotty, it would be a good idea to download these
data sets before arriving at the conference.

Please check back here in the days before the conference for instructions
on how to download the required data.
